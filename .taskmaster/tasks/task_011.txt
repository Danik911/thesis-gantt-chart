# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Audio Recording and Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive audio recording system for capturing research thoughts and reflections, integrated with the existing PDF and note-taking functionalities.
# Details:
1. Set up RecordRTC for browser-based audio recording:
   - Install RecordRTC library and integrate it into the React project
   - Create an AudioRecorder component with start, stop, and pause functionality
   - Implement error handling for unsupported browsers or devices

2. Develop audio playback interface:
   - Create a custom audio player component using HTML5 audio API
   - Implement play, pause, seek, and volume controls
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for playback control

3. Integrate with Firebase Storage:
   - Set up Firebase Storage rules for secure audio file access
   - Implement upload functionality for recorded audio files
   - Create functions for generating signed URLs for audio playback

4. Link audio recordings to PDFs and notes:
   - Modify the existing PDF viewer component to include an audio recording option
   - Update the note-taking system to allow attaching audio recordings to specific notes
   - Implement a data structure to store relationships between audio, PDFs, and notes

5. Implement audio metadata management:
   - Create a schema for audio metadata (duration, timestamp, title, associated document)
   - Develop functions to extract and store metadata upon audio upload
   - Implement a metadata editor for users to modify audio file information

6. Add waveform visualization:
   - Integrate Wavesurfer.js library into the project
   - Create a WaveformVisualizer component for audio navigation
   - Implement seek functionality by clicking on the waveform

7. Develop audio file organization and categorization:
   - Create a tagging system for audio files
   - Implement folder/collection functionality for organizing recordings
   - Add drag-and-drop functionality for easy organization

8. Implement search functionality:
   - Develop a search index for audio metadata
   - Create a search component with filtering options (by date, duration, associated document)
   - Implement real-time search results as the user types

9. Add export capabilities:
   - Implement audio file download functionality
   - Create options for exporting in different formats (M4A, WAV, MP3)
   - Add batch export functionality for multiple audio files

10. Prepare for future transcription enhancement:
    - Research and select a suitable speech-to-text API (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text)
    - Implement a placeholder component for future transcription feature
    - Ensure audio data structure can accommodate transcription data

11. Implement responsive design:
    - Ensure all audio-related components are mobile-friendly
    - Implement touch controls for mobile devices
    - Test and optimize performance on various screen sizes

12. Add quality settings and compression:
    - Implement audio quality selection before recording (e.g., low, medium, high)
    - Add client-side audio compression using Web Audio API
    - Ensure file size limits (100MB) are enforced

13. Implement real-time recording status indicators:
    - Create a visual indicator for active recording (e.g., pulsing red dot)
    - Add a timer display showing recording duration
    - Implement warning system for approaching storage limits

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write unit tests for all major components (AudioRecorder, AudioPlayer, WaveformVisualizer)
   - Test audio recording functions with mock data
   - Verify metadata extraction and management functions

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the integration of audio recording with PDF viewer and note-taking system
   - Verify correct storage and retrieval of audio files from Firebase
   - Ensure proper linking between audio files, PDFs, and notes

3. User Interface Testing:
   - Conduct usability tests for the audio recording and playback interface
   - Verify responsiveness of all audio-related components on different devices
   - Test keyboard shortcuts and touch controls

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and optimize loading times for audio files of various sizes
   - Test system performance with a large number of audio files
   - Verify smooth playback and waveform rendering for long audio files

5. Security Testing:
   - Ensure proper implementation of Firebase Storage security rules
   - Test access controls for audio files (only authorized users can access)
   - Verify secure handling of audio metadata

6. Compatibility Testing:
   - Test audio recording and playback on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Verify functionality on both desktop and mobile devices
   - Test with different audio input/output devices

7. Error Handling:
   - Simulate various error scenarios (e.g., storage full, network disconnection)
   - Verify appropriate error messages are displayed to the user
   - Test recovery mechanisms for interrupted recordings or uploads

8. Acceptance Testing:
   - Verify all requirements are met (formats supported, file size limits, etc.)
   - Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire audio workflow
   - Gather feedback from potential users and iterate on the implementation

9. Accessibility Testing:
   - Ensure audio controls are keyboard accessible
   - Test with screen readers to verify proper labeling and navigation
   - Verify color contrast ratios for visual elements

10. Load Testing:
    - Simulate concurrent audio recording and playback by multiple users
    - Test system performance under high load (many simultaneous uploads/downloads)
    - Verify Firebase Storage can handle the expected volume of audio files
