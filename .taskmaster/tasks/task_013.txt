# Task ID: 13
# Title: Build Review and Synthesis System for Thesis Writing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 11, 10, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive review system to facilitate thesis writing by providing unified access to all research materials, including a consolidated dashboard, advanced search functionality, synthesis workspace, citation management, and export tools.
# Details:
1. Set up unified dashboard:
   - Create a React component for the main dashboard
   - Implement a layout grid using CSS Grid or Flexbox
   - Design widgets for displaying notes, audio, and documents by topic/date

2. Implement advanced search functionality:
   - Install and configure Fuse.js for fuzzy searching
   - Create a search component with input field and filters
   - Implement search across all content types (PDFs, notes, audio)
   - Display search results with highlighting and content preview

3. Develop synthesis workspace:
   - Create a drag-and-drop interface for combining insights
   - Implement a rich text editor for writing synthesis content
   - Add functionality to link and cite original sources

4. Integrate citation management:
   - Implement citation storage in Firebase Firestore
   - Create components for adding, editing, and organizing citations
   - Develop citation formatting functions for APA, MLA, and Chicago styles

5. Build export tools:
   - Create export functions for various academic formats (PDF, DOCX, LaTeX)
   - Implement a chapter/section organization system
   - Develop a preview feature for exported content

6. Implement cross-reference visualization:
   - Use a graph visualization library (e.g., vis.js or cytoscape.js)
   - Create a data structure for representing relationships between content items
   - Develop interactive controls for exploring connections

7. Add content filtering and organization tools:
   - Implement tagging system for all content types
   - Create filter components for date ranges, content types, and tags
   - Develop a drag-and-drop interface for content organization

8. Create research timeline and progress visualization:
   - Integrate with the existing calendar system (Task 12)
   - Implement a timeline component showing research milestones and progress
   - Add progress tracking features tied to content creation and review

9. Implement collaboration features:
   - Set up Firebase Authentication for user management
   - Create sharing functionality for individual content items and collections
   - Implement real-time collaboration using Firebase Realtime Database

10. Integrate with external citation tools:
    - Research and implement APIs for Zotero and Mendeley
    - Create import/export functions for citation data
    - Develop synchronization features to keep citations up-to-date

11. Optimize performance:
    - Implement lazy loading for large content libraries
    - Use React.memo and useMemo for component optimization
    - Set up Firebase indexing for efficient querying

12. Ensure responsive design:
    - Implement a mobile-first approach using CSS media queries
    - Create adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
    - Optimize touch interactions for mobile and tablet devices

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write Jest tests for all utility functions (search, citation formatting, export)
   - Create React Testing Library tests for individual components

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the interaction between different modules (e.g., search affecting dashboard display)
   - Verify data flow between components and Firebase backend

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Use Cypress to create automated tests for key user workflows
   - Test the entire process from adding content to exporting a thesis chapter

4. Performance Testing:
   - Use React DevTools Profiler to identify and optimize rendering bottlenecks
   - Conduct load testing with large datasets to ensure smooth performance

5. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Test the application in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify functionality and appearance consistency across browsers

6. Responsive Design Testing:
   - Use browser developer tools to test various screen sizes and orientations
   - Conduct physical device testing on different smartphones and tablets

7. Accessibility Testing:
   - Use aXe or similar tools to check for accessibility issues
   - Conduct keyboard navigation testing for all features

8. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Recruit a group of thesis writers to use the system and provide feedback
   - Collect and analyze user experience data to inform refinements

9. Security Testing:
   - Conduct penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities
   - Verify proper implementation of Firebase security rules

10. Offline Functionality Testing:
    - Test the application's behavior with intermittent internet connection
    - Verify that data is properly synchronized when connection is restored
