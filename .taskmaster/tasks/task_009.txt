# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement PDF Upload and Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive PDF document management system for scientific papers and research articles, including upload, storage, viewing, and organization features.
# Details:
1. Set up Firebase Storage:
   - Configure Firebase Storage rules for secure file access
   - Implement server-side functions for generating signed URLs

2. Create PDF upload component:
   - Implement drag-and-drop interface using react-dropzone
   - Add file validation for PDF format and 50MB size limit
   - Integrate with Firebase Storage for file upload

3. Implement document metadata extraction:
   - Use pdf.js to extract metadata (title, authors, date)
   - Store metadata in Firestore alongside the file reference

4. Develop document library interface:
   - Create responsive grid/list views using CSS Grid or Flexbox
   - Implement lazy loading for efficient performance
   - Add sorting and filtering options (by date, category, tags)

5. Integrate PDF viewer:
   - Set up PDF.js or React-PDF for in-browser PDF viewing
   - Implement page navigation and zoom controls

6. Create thumbnail generation service:
   - Use pdf.js to render first page as thumbnail
   - Store thumbnails in Firebase Storage
   - Implement caching mechanism for quick loading

7. Implement search functionality:
   - Set up Firestore indexing for efficient queries
   - Create search component with autocomplete
   - Implement full-text search on document metadata

8. Develop document organization system:
   - Create UI for managing categories and tags
   - Implement drag-and-drop for organizing documents

9. Add basic annotation support:
   - Implement highlight and comment features
   - Store annotations in Firestore

10. Optimize performance:
    - Implement efficient loading strategies (pagination, virtual scrolling)
    - Use React.memo and useMemo for component optimization
    - Set up caching for frequently accessed data

11. Ensure responsive design:
    - Use CSS media queries for mobile/desktop layouts
    - Implement touch-friendly controls for mobile devices

12. Error handling and user feedback:
    - Implement error boundaries in React
    - Create user-friendly error messages and loading indicators

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write tests for PDF validation functions
   - Test metadata extraction accuracy
   - Verify thumbnail generation process

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test Firebase Storage upload and retrieval
   - Verify Firestore integration for metadata storage
   - Check PDF viewer integration and functionality

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Verify responsive design on various devices
   - Test drag-and-drop upload functionality
   - Ensure smooth navigation between grid/list views

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure load times for document library
   - Test search functionality with large datasets
   - Verify efficient loading of thumbnails and metadata

5. Security Testing:
   - Verify Firebase Storage security rules
   - Test access control for document management

6. Usability Testing:
   - Conduct user sessions for document organization
   - Test annotation features for ease of use

7. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Verify functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

8. Error Handling:
   - Test system behavior with network interruptions
   - Verify graceful handling of invalid PDF files

9. Accessibility Testing:
   - Use tools like axe-core to check WCAG compliance
   - Test keyboard navigation for all features

10. End-to-end Testing:
    - Create Cypress tests for critical user flows
    - Verify complete process from upload to viewing and organizing
