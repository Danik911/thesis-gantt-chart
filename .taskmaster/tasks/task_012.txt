# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Calendar-Based Progress Tracking System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 10, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an interactive calendar interface using FullCalendar React integration to visualize research activities and track document analysis progress, featuring multiple view modes, progress indicators, and integration with existing document and note systems.
# Details:
1. Set up FullCalendar with React:
   - Install @fullcalendar/react and required plugins (daygrid, timegrid, interaction)
   - Create a Calendar component with daily, weekly, and monthly view options
   - Implement custom event rendering for research-specific data

2. Integrate with Firebase Firestore:
   - Design a data structure for calendar events and progress data
   - Implement real-time listeners for document uploads and analysis completions
   - Create CRUD operations for calendar events

3. Develop progress tracking features:
   - Implement color-coded entries for different activity types (e.g., uploads, analyses, milestones)
   - Create progress indicators for document analysis completion
   - Design and implement visual analytics and progress summaries

4. Enhance user interaction:
   - Add click-to-view functionality for calendar entries
   - Implement event creation for uploaded documents and completed analyses
   - Create a responsive design for mobile and desktop views

5. Implement export capabilities:
   - Develop PDF export functionality using a library like jsPDF
   - Create CSV export option for raw data
   - Design and implement customizable progress report templates

6. Integrate with existing systems:
   - Link calendar events to the document management system (Task 9)
   - Connect note-taking system (Task 10) to relevant calendar entries
   - Integrate audio recordings (Task 11) with calendar events

7. Implement deadline tracking and milestone management:
   - Create a system for setting and visualizing deadlines
   - Implement milestone creation and tracking
   - Add notifications for upcoming deadlines and milestones

8. Optimize performance:
   - Implement lazy loading for calendar events
   - Use memoization for expensive calculations
   - Optimize Firebase queries for large datasets

9. Implement comprehensive error handling and loading states

10. Add unit and integration tests for all new components and functions

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write tests for all utility functions and helper methods
   - Test individual React components in isolation
   - Verify correct rendering of calendar views (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Test progress calculation and visualization functions

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test integration with Firebase Firestore (CRUD operations, real-time updates)
   - Verify correct interaction between calendar and existing document/note systems
   - Test export functionality for various formats (PDF, CSV)

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create test scenarios for common user workflows (e.g., creating events, tracking progress)
   - Test responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes
   - Verify real-time updates when documents are uploaded or analyzed

4. Performance Testing:
   - Load test with large datasets to ensure smooth performance
   - Measure and optimize render times for different calendar views
   - Test lazy loading implementation for efficiency

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct usability tests with a group of researchers
   - Gather feedback on the intuitiveness of the calendar interface
   - Verify that all required features are present and functioning as expected

6. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Test the calendar system across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Verify consistent functionality and appearance across platforms

7. Accessibility Testing:
   - Use automated tools (e.g., axe-core) to check for accessibility issues
   - Manually test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

8. Error Handling and Edge Case Testing:
   - Test system behavior with invalid inputs or unexpected data
   - Verify appropriate error messages and graceful degradation

9. Security Testing:
   - Verify that user data is properly protected and access controls are in place
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) in the calendar system

10. Regression Testing:
    - Ensure that the new calendar system doesn't break existing functionality
    - Verify integration points with document management, note-taking, and audio recording systems
