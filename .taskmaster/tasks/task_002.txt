# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Row Edit UI Components [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the necessary UI components for row editing functionality
### Details:
Design and implement UI elements including edit buttons, form inputs, save/cancel buttons, and visual indicators for rows in edit mode. Consider using modals or inline editing based on UX requirements.
<info added on 2025-06-03T10:33:47.510Z>
The row editing UI components have been successfully implemented in WeeklyGanttChart.js. The implementation includes:

- Edit state management using editingRow and editValue states
- Focus management through editInputRef
- Visual feedback system with showEditFeedback state
- Core editing functions: startEditing(), cancelEditing(), and saveEdit()
- Input validation via validateEditValue() that prevents empty names and duplicate names
- Keyboard event handling through handleEditKeyPress
- Support for both task and activity row editing
- Proper accessibility through focus management

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:

All planned row edit triggers have been successfully implemented:

1. Button-based triggers:
   - Edit button for tasks (Line 922)
