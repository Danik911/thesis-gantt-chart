# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Rich Note-Taking System Linked to PDFs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an advanced note-taking system that integrates seamlessly with uploaded PDF documents, featuring rich text editing, page-specific note linking, organization, and search capabilities.
# Details:
1. Set up TipTap rich text editor:
   - Install @tiptap/react and necessary extensions
   - Create a custom TipTap editor component with formatting options (bold, italic, underline, lists, etc.)
   - Implement custom extensions for research-specific features (e.g., citations, footnotes)

2. Implement page-specific note linking:
   - Develop a PDF viewer component using react-pdf or similar library
   - Create a data structure to store notes with PDF page coordinates
   - Implement click handlers on the PDF to create and display linked notes

3. Design note organization interface:
   - Create a sidebar component for note navigation
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for note reordering
   - Develop a folder/category system for note organization

4. Implement cross-referencing capabilities:
   - Create a linking system between notes and PDF sections
   - Develop a visual indicator for linked content in both notes and PDFs

5. Create note templates:
   - Design templates for common research tasks (literature review, methodology analysis, etc.)
   - Implement a template selection interface when creating new notes

6. Develop tag system:
   - Create a tag management interface
   - Implement tag assignment to notes
   - Develop a tag-based filtering system

7. Implement full-text search:
   - Integrate Fuse.js for advanced search capabilities
   - Index note content, titles, and tags for searching
   - Create a search interface with real-time results

8. Add version history and revision tracking:
   - Implement a versioning system for notes using Firebase Firestore
   - Create an interface to view and restore previous versions

9. Develop export functionality:
   - Implement PDF export using react-pdf
   - Create DOCX export using docx-js
   - Implement Markdown export

10. Implement real-time auto-saving:
    - Use Firebase Firestore real-time listeners for live updates
    - Implement debounce function to optimize auto-save frequency

11. Ensure responsive design:
    - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout
    - Implement media queries for various screen sizes
    - Test and optimize for mobile devices

12. Prepare for future collaborative editing:
    - Design data structures with multi-user editing in mind
    - Implement user authentication system
    - Create placeholder UI elements for collaborative features

Technical considerations:
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) for state management
- Implement custom hooks for reusable logic (e.g., useAutoSave, useSearch)
- Optimize rendering performance using React.memo and useMemo
- Use TypeScript for improved code quality and developer experience
- Follow Firebase best practices for data structuring and security rules

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write Jest tests for individual components (TipTap editor, PDF viewer, note list)
   - Test utility functions (e.g., note linking, search indexing)

2. Integration Testing:
   - Use React Testing Library to test component interactions
   - Verify correct data flow between components and Firebase

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Implement Cypress tests for critical user flows:
     a. Create a note linked to a specific PDF page
     b. Edit and format a note using rich text features
     c. Search for notes and verify results
     d. Export notes in different formats

4. Performance Testing:
   - Use React DevTools Profiler to identify and optimize rendering bottlenecks
   - Test auto-save functionality with large documents to ensure responsiveness

5. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Verify functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Test on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)

6. Accessibility Testing:
   - Use aXe or similar tools to check WCAG compliance
   - Test keyboard navigation throughout the application

7. Security Testing:
   - Verify Firebase security rules prevent unauthorized access
   - Test file upload validation to prevent malicious file uploads

8. Usability Testing:
   - Conduct user testing sessions with researchers
   - Gather feedback on interface intuitiveness and feature completeness

9. Offline Functionality Testing:
   - Test application behavior when internet connection is lost
   - Verify data synchronization when connection is restored

10. Error Handling:
    - Simulate various error conditions (e.g., Firebase connection issues)
    - Verify appropriate error messages are displayed to users
