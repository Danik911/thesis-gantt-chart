2. Complete Folder Management:
   - Design a hierarchical folder structure in Firestore
   - Implement CRUD operations for folders (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Develop a tree-view component for folder navigation
   - Add drag-and-drop functionality for organizing notes within folders

3. Enhanced Tag System:
   - Implement full CRUD operations for tags
   - Develop an autocomplete component for tag input
   - Create a tag cloud visualization component
   - Implement bulk tag operations (add/remove tags to multiple notes)

4. Fixed File Association:
   - Refactor the existing PDF library integration
   - Implement bidirectional linking between notes and PDF files
   - Store file associations in Firestore with proper indexing
   - Develop a UI component for managing file associations

5. Firebase Storage Optimization:
   - Redesign Firestore data structure for efficient querying
   - Implement proper indexing for frequently accessed fields
   - Set up Firebase Security Rules for data protection
   - Use Firebase SDK for real-time updates and offline persistence

6. User Interface Enhancements:
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions (new note, save, navigate)
   - Develop an export functionality for backing up notes (JSON format)
   - Create a settings panel for user preferences (theme, default view, etc.)

7. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement lazy loading for notes list
   - Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations
   - Optimize Firebase queries with pagination and limiting

8. Cross-browser Compatibility:
   - Test and ensure functionality across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Implement necessary polyfills or fallbacks for older browsers

9. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application
   - Set up error logging to Firebase Analytics or a third-party service

10. Documentation:
    - Create user documentation for new features and workflows
    - Update developer documentation with new architecture and components

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write unit tests for all new components and functions using Jest and React Testing Library
   - Ensure at least 80% code coverage for new features

2. Integration Testing:
   - Use Playwright to create end-to-end tests for key user workflows:
     a. Creating, editing, and deleting notes
     b. Organizing notes in folders
     c. Adding and removing tags
     d. Associating notes with PDF files
     e. Searching and filtering notes
   - Test real-time updates across multiple browser instances

3. Performance Testing:
   - Use Lighthouse to measure and optimize page load times and performance scores
   - Test application performance with a large number of notes (1000+) to ensure scalability

4. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Use BrowserStack or similar service to test on multiple browser and OS combinations
   - Ensure consistent functionality and appearance across platforms

5. Usability Testing:
   - Conduct user testing sessions with a small group of target users
   - Gather feedback on new features and overall user experience

6. Security Testing:
   - Perform penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities
   - Verify Firebase Security Rules are correctly implemented and preventing unauthorized access

7. Offline Functionality Testing:
   - Test application behavior when offline and verify data synchronization when connection is restored

8. Accessibility Testing:
   - Use aXe or similar tools to check WCAG 2.1 compliance
   - Perform manual testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation

9. Error Handling Testing:
   - Simulate various error conditions (network issues, Firebase errors) to ensure proper error handling and user feedback

10. Regression Testing:
    - Verify that existing GANTT chart functionality remains unaffected by new changes
    - Run automated tests for all previously implemented features
