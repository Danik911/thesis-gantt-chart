# Task ID: 8
# Title: Setup React + Firebase Architecture for Academic Research Tool
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the existing GANTT chart application to use modern React.js architecture with Firebase backend integration, preserving existing functionality while setting up a new development environment.
# Details:
1. Create new React application:
   - Use Create React App or Vite with TypeScript template
   - Install necessary dependencies: react-router-dom, firebase, @reduxjs/toolkit (if using Redux)

2. Set up Firebase project:
   - Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console
   - Enable Firestore, Storage, and Authentication services
   - Generate and save Firebase configuration keys

3. Implement Firebase integration:
   - Create a firebase.ts file to initialize Firebase app and export service instances
   - Implement authentication methods (signIn, signOut, onAuthStateChanged)
   - Create Firestore utility functions for CRUD operations

4. Set up routing structure:
   - Implement React Router with routes for main pages (e.g., Dashboard, GANTT Chart, Settings)
   - Create layout components (e.g., Header, Sidebar, Footer)

5. Migrate GANTT chart functionality:
   - Convert existing GANTT chart code to React components
   - Implement hooks for state management (useState, useEffect)
   - Ensure all existing features are preserved (row editing, chart manipulation)

6. Implement state management:
   - Set up Redux store with slices for different data types (user, projects, tasks)
   - Create actions and reducers for GANTT chart operations
   - Implement React-Redux hooks (useSelector, useDispatch) in components

7. Create foundational components:
   - Implement reusable UI components (Button, Input, Modal, etc.)
   - Create service layer for API calls and data transformations

8. Ensure responsive design:
   - Implement CSS modules or styled-components for component-specific styles
   - Use flexbox or grid for responsive layouts
   - Test and adjust layouts for various screen sizes

9. Set up development tools:
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
   - Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests
   - Implement Storybook for component documentation (optional)

10. Preserve GitHub Pages deployment:
    - Update build scripts to output to the correct directory for GitHub Pages
    - Modify GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy the React app

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write unit tests for all new React components using Jest and React Testing Library
   - Test Firebase service functions with mock Firebase instances
   - Ensure all existing GANTT chart functionalities have corresponding unit tests

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the interaction between React components and Firebase services
   - Verify that data flows correctly between the frontend and backend
   - Test authentication flow and protected routes

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Use a tool like Cypress to write E2E tests for critical user flows
   - Test the complete GANTT chart functionality in the new React environment
   - Verify that row editing and other existing features work as expected

4. Performance Testing:
   - Use React DevTools profiler to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks
   - Test application load time and runtime performance
   - Verify that Firebase queries are efficient and don't cause unnecessary re-renders

5. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Test the application in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Ensure consistent functionality and appearance across browsers

6. Responsive Design Testing:
   - Test the application on various device sizes and orientations
   - Verify that all features are accessible and usable on mobile devices

7. Accessibility Testing:
   - Use tools like axe-core to check for accessibility issues
   - Ensure proper keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

8. Deployment Testing:
   - Verify that the application builds and deploys correctly to GitHub Pages
   - Test the deployed version to ensure all features work in the production environment

9. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct a UAT session with stakeholders to ensure the new architecture meets requirements
   - Gather feedback on user experience and any potential issues

10. Security Testing:
    - Verify that Firebase security rules are properly implemented
    - Test authentication and authorization mechanisms
    - Ensure that sensitive data is properly protected
