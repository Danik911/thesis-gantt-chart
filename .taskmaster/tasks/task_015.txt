# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Notes Persistence System with Auto-Save and Manual Save
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a robust notes persistence system with automatic and manual save functionality, using localStorage for data persistence across browser sessions and providing visual indicators for save status.
# Details:
1. Set up state management:
   - Use React useState hook to manage the notes state
   - Create a state for save status (e.g., 'saving', 'saved', 'error')

2. Implement auto-save functionality:
   - Use React useEffect hook to watch for changes in the notes state
   - Implement a debounce function (e.g., using lodash.debounce) to limit save frequency
   - Create a saveToLocalStorage function to handle the actual saving process

3. Add manual save button:
   - Create a button component for manual saves
   - Implement an onClick handler that triggers the saveToLocalStorage function

4. Persist notes using localStorage:
   - In the saveToLocalStorage function, use JSON.stringify to convert notes object to string
   - Use localStorage.setItem to save the stringified notes
   - Handle potential localStorage errors (e.g., quota exceeded) with try/catch

5. Implement visual indicators for save status:
   - Create a StatusIndicator component that displays the current save status
   - Update the save status state based on the saving process (saving, saved, error)

6. Add data validation and error handling:
   - Implement a validateNotes function to check data integrity before saving
   - Handle edge cases like localStorage being full or unavailable

7. Create fallback behavior:
   - Implement in-memory storage as a fallback if localStorage is unavailable
   - Provide user feedback and options when persistent storage is not possible

8. Load saved notes on startup:
   - In a useEffect hook with an empty dependency array, attempt to load notes from localStorage
   - Use JSON.parse to convert the stored string back to an object
   - Handle potential errors during parsing or loading

9. Handle localStorage quota exceeded:
   - Implement a function to check available storage space
   - If quota is nearly exceeded, prompt user to delete old or unnecessary notes
   - Provide clear user feedback when storage limit is reached

Example code snippet for auto-save implementation:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce';

const NotesEditor = () => {
  const [notes, setNotes] = useState('');
  const [saveStatus, setSaveStatus] = useState('saved');

  const saveToLocalStorage = async (content) => {
    setSaveStatus('saving');
    try {
      await localStorage.setItem('userNotes', JSON.stringify(content));
      setSaveStatus('saved');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error saving notes:', error);
      setSaveStatus('error');
    }
  };

  const debouncedSave = debounce(saveToLocalStorage, 1000);

  useEffect(() => {
    debouncedSave(notes);
    return () => debouncedSave.cancel();
  }, [notes]);

  // ... rest of the component logic
};
```

Ensure proper error boundaries are set up to catch and handle any unexpected errors during the save/load process.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test debounce functionality by mocking timer functions and asserting saveToLocalStorage is called after the specified delay
   - Test saveToLocalStorage function with various input scenarios (valid input, empty input, very large input)
   - Test error handling by mocking localStorage to throw errors and asserting correct error states

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test auto-save feature by simulating user input and verifying localStorage is updated after the debounce period
   - Test manual save button functionality
   - Verify correct loading of saved notes on component mount

3. End-to-End Tests:
   - Simulate a full user session with typing, navigating away, and returning to verify data persistence
   - Test application behavior when localStorage is full or unavailable
   - Verify visual indicators update correctly for different save states

4. Performance Tests:
   - Measure the impact of auto-save on application performance, especially with large amounts of text
   - Test with simulated slow storage to ensure the UI remains responsive

5. Edge Case Tests:
   - Test behavior when switching between multiple browser tabs
   - Verify graceful handling of corrupt data in localStorage
   - Test with various browser storage settings (e.g., private browsing mode)

6. Accessibility Tests:
   - Ensure save status indicators are accessible to screen readers
   - Verify keyboard navigation for manual save functionality

7. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Verify consistent behavior across different browsers and versions
   - Test on both desktop and mobile browsers

8. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on the auto-save and manual save features
   - Verify that the persistence system meets user expectations for data safety and control
