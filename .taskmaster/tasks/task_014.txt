# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Tag Deletion Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Add the ability to delete tags in the text notes system, including UI elements, confirmation dialogs, and cascading deletion across associated notes.
# Details:
1. Update Tag Management Interface:
   - Add a delete button/icon next to each tag in the tag list
   - Use a trash can icon from a library like react-icons

2. Implement Confirmation Dialog:
   - Create a reusable ConfirmationDialog component using React hooks
   - Display the dialog when the delete button is clicked
   - Include clear warning message and confirm/cancel buttons

3. Create Tag Deletion Logic:
   - Implement a deleteTag function in the tag management service
   - Use Firebase Firestore batch operations for atomic updates
   - Remove the tag from the tags collection
   - Update all notes that use the tag, removing it from their tag arrays

4. Update React Components:
   - Modify the TagList component to include delete functionality
   - Use React Context or Redux to manage global state updates
   - Implement loading state during deletion process

5. Add Visual Feedback:
   - Display a loading spinner during the deletion process
   - Show success/error toast notifications using a library like react-toastify

6. Implement Error Handling:
   - Create a custom error handling function for deletion failures
   - Display user-friendly error messages
   - Log detailed errors for debugging purposes

7. Ensure Persistence:
   - Verify that deletions are reflected in Firebase Firestore
   - Implement local state updates to reflect changes immediately

8. Optimize Performance:
   - Use React.memo for pure components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Implement debounce for delete operations if needed

9. Update Unit Tests:
   - Write new unit tests for the deleteTag function
   - Update existing tests affected by the new functionality

10. Document the New Feature:
    - Update user documentation to explain the tag deletion process
    - Add inline code comments explaining complex logic

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test the deleteTag function with various scenarios (single tag, multiple notes)
   - Verify error handling for network issues or permission problems
   - Test the ConfirmationDialog component in isolation

2. Integration Testing:
   - Ensure proper communication between UI components and Firebase
   - Verify that tag deletion updates are reflected across all relevant components

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Confirm that the delete button appears correctly in the tag management interface
   - Verify that the confirmation dialog displays and functions as expected
   - Test the visual feedback (loading spinners, success/error notifications)

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure the response time for tag deletion operations
   - Verify that the UI remains responsive during deletion processes

5. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test deletion of tags with a large number of associated notes
   - Attempt to delete the same tag simultaneously from multiple clients

6. Persistence Testing:
   - Verify that tag deletions persist after page reloads and across different devices
   - Check that deleted tags are removed from all associated notes

7. Error Handling:
   - Simulate network errors and verify appropriate error messages
   - Test deletion with insufficient user permissions

8. Accessibility Testing:
   - Ensure that the delete functionality is keyboard accessible
   - Verify that screen readers can interpret the confirmation dialog correctly

9. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Test the tag deletion feature on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

10. User Acceptance Testing:
    - Conduct a small-scale user test to gather feedback on the deletion process
    - Verify that the feature meets all specified requirements
